## UFOMO (backend)

<hr>

After years of drifting alone in the galaxy, wouldn't you get lonely? Follow this lonely alien and his quest to make a friend. Use the arrow keys to control your friend to maneuver around potential harmful obstacles. Make sure he gets to your ship safely!

The goal was to create a single page application using Javascript to handle the UX. For the graphics, we used an 8-bit picture editor, and we integrated Ruby on Rails to handle new users and their high scores.

## Concerns and Issues

* Addition of game progression and levels
* Would like to add new obstacles
* Refactoring and cleaning up of code
